# Shyft

This is the third project I worked on at DevMountain Coding Bootcamp.

I joined a group where we collectively decided to learn Reactjs by cloning the popular ride-share website lyft.com.

Our goal was to create a fully operational clone of lyft.com, including ride cost estimation, mobile responsiveness, specific city pages, as well as a simulation of lyft.com's mobile ride finder with Facebook authentication where a user can create new rides, and see them in a user dashboard.

## Getting Started

Instructions: 
- Explore the front page, as well as the each specific city page where you use the ride cost calculator
- Click on 'Ride with Shyft', login with Facebook, and Find a ride.
- After creating a ride you can go to the user dashboard and see previous rides.

This application is hosted on my Digital Ocean droplet @  http://shyft.site/

### Design

We chose to clone Lyfts website because it displays a great example of a clean, modern web design . This site works in mobile mode, but was primarily designed for fullscreen. Also, we attempted to design our own version of Lyfts mobile app in the 'Ride with Shyft' section.

### MVP and Summary

Minimum viable product:
- Front Page, Cities Pages, 'Ride with Shyft' section
- Use Lyft's and GoogleMap's api to display nearby drivers live, as well as calculate ride costs
- Design a pixel-perfect clone of Lyft.com including animations.

This project was super fun. It provided our group with the challenge of learning a new framework, ReactJs, and implement it into a full stand-alone project in less than 3 weeks. This was my first experience with working in a group, I learned a lot about team coordination, group stand-ups, agile practices, as well as github flow. I really enjoyed making GoogleMaps and Lyfts api work together. Also I really enjoyed learning and understanding components with Reactjs. This project was a overall a great experience.
